            <p>
                This "lab" is a programming playground for me to try out stuff that I learned or find interested.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might find most of the projects here useless since my goal was never to create useful stuff. 
                The projects here are, however, most definitely fun. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the projects here are published under the public domain, with a few exceptions that is using 
                MIT license. Please refer to the <tt>LICENSE</tt> file in each project for details. If the
                license for a project is not specified, you are free to assume it as the public domain.

                This network is called "MrSheep NET" for no reason, it is just a random name.
                It may sound informal, but we just love to do so.

                    <a href="https://mrsheep.xyz" target="_blank">MrSheep NET</a>
                    <p>
                        We operate <a href="https://bgp.he.net/AS208884" target="_blank">AS208884</a>, a non-profit eudcational network.

                    <a href="https://portal.mrsheep.xyz" target="_blank">Proxy Service</a>
                    <p>
                        We provide proxy services, to help people bypass internet censorship. 
                        We believe that the internet should remain neutral and uncensored. <br />
                        Currently all the servers are running <a href="https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core">Xray</a> (with <a href="https://github.com/ColetteContreras/v2ray-poseidon/">v2ray-poseidon</a> to provide an automated multiuser system.) <br />
                        If you have any spare servers(even a Raspberry Pi) and want to help censored users, please drop an email to <a href="mailto:admin@mrsheep.xyz">admin@mrsheep.xyz</a>
                    </p>
                    <a>IPv6 tunnel</a>
                    <p>
                        We provide ipv6 tunnel broker service for free (fair use) to help users without public IPv4 or IPv6 access. Just send an email to <a href="mailto:noc@mrsheep.xyz">noc@mrsheep.xyz</a>, and we'll configure the session for you. <br />
                        Note: SLA is not guaranteed.
                        <br />

                    <a>DNS server</a>
                    <p>
                        DNS pollution is not acceptable, so we decide to host our own DNS servers. Currently hosting DNS server only in China to provide user a clean resolver.
                        The bandwidth is limited, so the query time may not be satisfying. <br />
                        Since this is still a experimental project, we will collect user query log with their IP anonymized, the log will then be use to block advertising and tracking domains. <br />
                        TTL for logs is 24hours <br />
                        If you still want to try it: https://resolve.cod.edu.pl:1053/dns-query <br />

            <p>
                This section has been moved to <a href="https://as208884.net">as208884.net</a> since we already purchased that domain and don't want to waste it.
                <br />
                Also because we are too lazy to copy and paste code from another html file.
